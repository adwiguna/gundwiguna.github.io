        Your tread must be light and sure, as though your path were upon rice paper. It is said, a
        Shaolin priest can walk through walls. Looked for, he can not be seen. Listened for, he can
        not be heard. Touched, can not be felt. This rice paper is the test. Fragile as the wings of
        the dragonfly, clinging as the cocoon of the silk worm. When you can walk its length and
        leave no trace. You will have learned.
