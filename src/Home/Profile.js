        People usually call me Anggun or Gun. I wear glasses everyday to help my myopic eyes see the
        world. Mostly I spent my time on computer to finish my work, or else to enjoy watching
        videos and playing games with friends. I studied computer science at Udayana University in
        major of Computer Science and have accuired my bachelor degree.

        My top skills are working with JavaScript library such as ReactJS to develop interactive
        user experience/user interface front-end page. With the help of SCSS and other node
        dependencies, I have some experiences in building front-end pages to communicate the
        application with the user. I also have understaing in Git as version control, tasks board,
        and agile SCRUM methodology that make me able to work together with the others as a team.
        Some of my other abilities are relating to operate computer efficiently and general computer
        troubleshooting.

        I speak in bahasa everyday but I also can communicate in English and Iâ€™m still learning to
        get better on it. I would love to get a job where I can apply my abilities especially for
        front-end web programming.
