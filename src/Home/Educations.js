        Don't go to bed, with no price on your head. No, no, don't do it. Fon't do the crime, if you
        can't do the time, yeah, don't do it. And keep your eye on the sparrow, when the going gets
        narrow. Don't do it, don't do it. Where can I go where the cold winds don't blow, Now. Well,
        well, well.

        Yogi Bear is smarter than the average bear, Yogi Bear is always in the ranger's hair. At a
        picnic table you will find him there, stuffing down more goodies than the average bear. He
        will sleep till noon but before it's dark, he'll have every picnic basket that's in
        Jellystone Park. Yogi has it better than a millionaire. That's because he's smarter than the
        average bear!

        Our whole universe was in a hot dense state, then nearly fourteen billion years ago
        expansion started. Wait... The Earth began to cool, the autotrophs began to drool.
        Neanderthals developed tools, we built a wall (we built the pyramids). Math, science,
        history, unraveling the mysteries, that all started with the big bang!
